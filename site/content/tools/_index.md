title: "Tools and Techniques"
text: >
    Being a remote-first, small I.T. consultancy means we have tried a lot of tools and are always trying to improve our techniques. If you are willing to suggest better ones, or want us to add a missing section, please [let us know](/contact) in exchange for some goodies!
footer: >
    **What about Testing, Marketing, Measurement, Analytics, Admin tools and techniques?** You are right! We want to cover those but just did  not write it yet. 
tools:
  - heading: "Communication"
    text: For remote-teams, a shared channel of communication is critical.
    details:
      - name: SLACK
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/slack.svg"
        description: >
          We currently use [Slack](https://slack.com), organized into per-client rooms as our primary means of communication on a project and we invite client team members to join.

      - name: GOOGLE HANGOUTS
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/google-hangouts.svg"
        description: >
          For adhoc voice and video meetings we use [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/). All team members are expected to have a working mic and cam, though we understand some people have unavoidable noisy working conditions sometimes.
    
      - name: GOOGLE DRIVE
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/google-drive.svg"
        description: >
          We store shared documents and client documents on our [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/). We have a shared team drive, and a company exec drive.
    
      - name: GMAIL
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/gmail.svg"
        description: >
          Everyone who joins us gets a cell5 gmail account for registering with SaaS products and client and team email communication.
      
  - heading: "Tracking"
    details: 
      - name: TRELLO
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/trello.svg"
        description: >
          We track tasks, ownership, progress, and prioritzation on a single shared [Trello](https://trello.com) board. The columns used are up to the team, but we focus on finishing things and limiting work-in-progress.

      - name: WEEKLY MEETING
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/weekly-meeting.svg"
        description: >
          We have a single weekly meeting per product, which provides a rhythm. The agenda is flexible. It usually includes things like: Decision Making, Reminders to action, and information sharing.  
        
        
          This meeting is not for feature review or sign off, or even backlog pruning as those activities happen when they are needed during the week. That said it would commonly involve some tweak to short term prioritization.
  - heading: "Design"
    details: 
      - name: BOOTSTRAP OR MATERIA"
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/bootstrap.svg"
        description: >
          We prefer to use a design system such as  [Material](https://material.io/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for most of the application UI/UX and focus  any creative, on specific areas or widgets that are key. 


          Having a common design system just makes the communication and delivery that much faster, and they have sensible out of box defaults incorporating usability  research and tooling integration which makes mobile-first easier. 

      - name: FIGMA
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/figma.svg"
        description: >
          We highly recommend [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as a collaborative design and rapid protoyping tool. 
      

          Once a design system is in place and main journies are mapped out design spend is usually less as the developers can follow the patterns in place.

  - heading: "Development"
    details: 
      - name: GITHUB AND TRUNK
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/github.svg"
        description: >
          We use [GitHub](https://github.com/cell-5) for version control and [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). 

      - name: PULL REQUEST
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/pull-request.svg"
        description: >
          We use Pull Requests, and every PR should be a [discrete slice of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_slice), that has a screen-cast attached with the developer demoing the feature. This is shared by Slack and email to the relevant team members for technical and feature review. If it too large it will be rejected.

      - name: VSCODE AND JETBRAINS
        imageUrl: "/img/SVG/tools/vscode.svg"
        description: >
          For development each language has its best tools but we like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for front end and the [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) suite of tools like GoLand, PHPStorm and IntelliJ for most back end work.
