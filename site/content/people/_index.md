      I co-founded Cell 5 in Jan 2018. 


      I am **accountable for delivery**, so I focus on recruitment, blending the right teams, and unblocking them. I listen to clients and the team and change things quickly when needed.


      I like to think that my 15 years experience of making mistakes in the software industry means I have less left to make!

      Ronnel joined in July 2019. 


      "When I joined Cell 5 I wanted to grow by getting variety and I get to do quality work for multiple start-up companies. Having flexibility in my work schedule, helps not only with my work-life balance but also makes me productive because I can work at times I know I am at my fullest.


      I appreciate the aspiration here, to have a culture of knowledge sharing and empathy - making mistakes is an opportunity to learn more - there is no such thing as a stupid question."
