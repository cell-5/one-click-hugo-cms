    Each big decision we make as an organization, is measured against these values, especially to filter [the people](/people) and [the clients](/clients) we work with.

    For existing or previous clients, if you think we can do a better job of representing you, or if there is an opportunity to share value about our work together, we would love the chance to collaborate on that content! Contact us

  - heading: "Take action, over deliberation"
    text: >
      In our experience execution informs strategy the best. 
      

      Indecision and standing still is not a strategy. 
      
      
      We advise clients to get something live and iterate and we release early and often, in the spirit of [Build-Measure-Learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Build-Measure-Learn).

  - heading: "Focus on long term value"
    text: >
      We make recruitment and investment decisions from a long-term perspective as this is the only rational way to grow a team, reputation and business. 

      
      We welcome clients who share this approach. 
      
      
      They need to demonstrate a long term vision focused on value creation, for their customers.

  - heading: "Champion remote-first teams"
    text: >    
      We believe distributed  remote teams are presently the best way to deliver value to clients.  


      Running our business this way keeps our costs down while at the same time it offers our remote employees a better work-life balance, and often better full compensation than working in under-valued local markets on legacy incumbent products.

  - heading: "Encourage small businesses & profit sharing"
    text: >
      We proudly redistribute 10% of profit as bonuses to our Philippines team at year end.
      
      
      We encourage our team to do side-hussles, or be enterpenuerial provided they deliver for us. We offer a leadership and micro-finance scheme for anyone in the team with an idea they are willing to lead and execute.
      

      For clients, we offer fee discounts in exchange for equity. This is a no-brainer as we only partner with clients that can convince us their business has merit and is focused on long term value.

  - heading: "Fail fast, but differently"
    text: >
      We encourage a culture that is not judgemental about failure. We all know we learn from failing.
      

      That said, we expect and demand transparency about failure in order that we can maximize the learning and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

  - heading: "Have empathy"
    text: >
      The software industry is awash with egos and arrogance and one-up-man-ship which we think gets in the way of team performance. 
    
      
      We recognise individual contributions, but we always put the team ahead of the individual during conflict-resolution and decision-making.
